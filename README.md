# 🛒 Product Recommender System

A comprehensive **Product Recommendation System** built using Python and Machine Learning techniques.  
This project implements **Content-Based**, **Collaborative Filtering**, and **Hybrid** recommendation approaches to deliver personalized product suggestions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Content-Based Filtering** – Recommends products similar to those a user liked, based on product features.  
- ✅ **Collaborative Filtering** – Suggests products using user–product interaction patterns.  
- ✅ **Hybrid Model** – Combines both for improved personalization and accuracy.  
- ✅ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Handles missing values, encodes data, and scales features.  
- ✅ **Jupyter Notebook Implementation** – Easy to understand, visualize, and extend.

## 🧮 Approaches Explained

```latex
\section*{1. Content-Based Filtering}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Uses product metadata (title, category, description).
  \item Represents products as TF-IDF vectors.
  \item Computes similarity using cosine distance:
    \[
    \text{similarity}(A,B) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\section*{2. Collaborative Filtering}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Based on user–item interaction matrix.
  \item Learns hidden user/item features using SVD.
  \item Predicts missing preferences:
    \[
    \hat{r}_{ui} = P_u^T Q_i
    \]
\end{itemize}

\section*{3. Hybrid Model}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Combines both similarity-based and rating-based scores.
  \item Produces more accurate and diverse recommendations.
\end{itemize}
```

## 📊 Example Output

```latex
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{User ID} & \textbf{Recommended Products} \\
\hline
101 & Product A, Product B, Product C \\
205 & Product D, Product E, Product F \\
309 & Product G, Product H, Product I \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Sample Recommendations for Users}
\end{table}
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

```latex
\begin{itemize}
  \item Deploy the system as a web app using Streamlit or Flask.
  \item Integrate real-world e-commerce product datasets.
  \item Add real-time personalization from live user activity.
  \item Use deep learning models such as Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF).
  \item Evaluate with metrics like RMSE, Precision@k, Recall@k, and F1-score.
\end{itemize}
```
