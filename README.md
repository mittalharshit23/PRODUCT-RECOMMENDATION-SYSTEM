# ðŸ›’ Product Recommender System

A comprehensive **Product Recommendation System** built using Python and Machine Learning techniques.  
This project implements **Content-Based**, **Collaborative Filtering**, and **Hybrid** recommendation approaches to deliver personalized product suggestions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **Content-Based Filtering** â€“ Recommends products similar to those a user liked, based on product features.  
- âœ… **Collaborative Filtering** â€“ Suggests products using userâ€“product interaction patterns.  
- âœ… **Hybrid Model** â€“ Combines both for improved personalization and accuracy.  
- âœ… **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** â€“ Handles missing values, encodes data, and scales features.  
- âœ… **Jupyter Notebook Implementation** â€“ Easy to understand, visualize, and extend.

## ðŸ§® Approaches Explained


1. **Content-Based Filtering**
  Uses product metadata (title, category, description).
  Represents products as TF-IDF vectors.
  Computes similarity using cosine distance:
   

2. **Collaborative Filtering**
  Based on userâ€“item interaction matrix.
  Learns hidden user/item features using SVD.
  Predicts missing preferences:
   
3. **Hybrid Model**
  Combines both similarity-based and rating-based scores.
  Produces more accurate and diverse recommendations.

## ðŸ“Š Example Output
| USER      |        RECOMMENDED PRODUCTS     |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
|     101   | Product A, Product B, Product C |
|     205   | Product D, Product E, Product F |
|     309   | Product G, Product H, Product I |

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- Deploy the system as a web app using Streamlit or Flask.  
- Integrate real-world e-commerce product datasets.
- Add real-time personalization from live user activity.
- Use deep learning models such as Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF).
- Evaluate with metrics like RMSE, Precision@k, Recall@k, and F1-score.
