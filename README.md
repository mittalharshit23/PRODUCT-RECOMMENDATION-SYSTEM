# ðŸ›’ Product Recommendation System (ML Project)

An end-to-end **Machine Learning Recommender System** built using Collaborative Filtering (Truncated SVD) and Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF Similarity).  
It predicts user preferences and recommends top N products, similar to Amazonâ€™s recommendation engine.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview
- **Collaborative Filtering (CF):** Uses `TruncatedSVD` to learn latent factors from the user-item matrix.
- **Content-Based Filtering (CBF):** Computes TF-IDF vectors for product descriptions and uses cosine similarity.
- **Hybrid Recommendation:** Combines top results from both models.
